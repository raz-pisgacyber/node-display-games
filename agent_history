- Reviewed drag behaviour for node marbles. Child nodes were realigned by the parent's automatic layout after pointer release, which snapped them back to their default orbit.
- Added a `manualPosition` flag to `NodeBase` instances so that once a node is dragged it retains its dropped coordinates. Automatic layout now skips nodes flagged as manually positioned while still arranging the remaining nodes.
- No automated tests are present in the project; behaviour verified by code inspection only. Future iterations should consider adding interaction tests for drag-and-drop flows if the runtime environment allows.

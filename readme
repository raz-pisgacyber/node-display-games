# Node Display Games Builder

This project is a modular browser-based builder for organizing creative writing projects.

## Running the Project Locally

Modern browsers block ES module imports when loading files directly from the file system. To avoid the `Access to script ... has been blocked by CORS policy` error, serve the repository through a local web server instead of opening `project.html` with the `file://` protocol.

### Option 1: Built-in Node server (recommended)
1. Ensure you have Node.js installed.
2. From the repository root run:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:8080/modules/project/project.html in your browser.

### Option 2: Any static server
You can also use other static servers such as:

```bash
npx http-server
# or
python -m http.server
```

Serve from the repository root and visit the same `/modules/project/project.html` path in your browser.

## Project Structure
- `core/` – shared utilities, base node logic, and styling.
- `modules/project/` – project-specific node implementation and entry point.
- `server.js` – lightweight static server used by `npm start`.
